Hello folks!

This is my first and certainly not my last project written in React and TypeScript.

If you are using React/TS then you know that you need to shift your thinking regarding writing code, especially if you have been doing it in pure JavaScript. It was certainly a big challenge for me to get the code to adapt to the new library, but as I added more and more sections to the site and content, certain things got into the habit and became easier to implement.

I hope that future projects in React/TS will teach me new things in addition to new challenges, because writing code is incredibly fun.

This page is created for a Polish instagramer, who just like loves what she does :) Enjoy and please leave feedback, about desing, code etc.

Cheers!
